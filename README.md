# AtlasNomad
Dev Bootcamp Final Project - Website that aggregates and visualizes travel content.  
Try out the deployed app [here](atlas-nomad.herokuapp.com). Have fun exploring!

Literally the coolest interactive map you will ever see. Built in a week by a 4-person team:

Alex Kass [@alexrkass](github.com/alexrkass) 
Benoit Demonsant [@keops6fr](github.com/keops6fr)  
David Grotting [@dgrotting](github.com/dgrotting)  
Josh Ullman [@joshullman](github.com/joshullman)

The map component is [JVectorMap](https://github.com/bjornd/jvectormap) by @bjornd, which we have licensed under the GPLv3. Jvectormap is also available for commercial licensing at [jvectormap.com](http://jvectormap.com).
