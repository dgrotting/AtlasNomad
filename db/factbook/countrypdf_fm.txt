￼The World FactbookAustralia-Oceania :: Micronesia, Federated States of Introduction :: Micronesia, Federated States ofBackground:The Caroline Islands are a widely scattered archipelago in the western Pacific Ocean; they became part of a UN Trust Territory under US administration following World War II. The eastern four island groups adopted a constitution in 1979 and chose to become the Federated States of Micronesia. (The fifth, westernmost island group became Palau.) Independence came in 1986 under a Compact of Free Association with the US, which was amended and renewed in 2004. Present concerns include large-scale unemployment, overfishing, and overdependence on US aid.Geography :: Micronesia, Federated States ofLocation:Oceania, island group in the North Pacific Ocean, about three-quarters of the way from Hawaii to IndonesiaGeographic coordinates:6 55 N, 158 15 EMap references:OceaniaArea:total: 702 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 191land: 702 sq kmwater: 0 sq km (fresh water only)note: includes Pohnpei (Ponape), Chuuk (Truk) Islands, Yap Islands, and Kosrae (Kosaie) Area - comparative:four times the size of Washington, DC (land area only)Land boundaries:0kmCoastline:6,112 kmMaritime claims:territorial sea: 1 2 n mexclusive economic zone: 200 nm Climate:tropical; heavy year-round rainfall, especially in the eastern islands; located on southern edge of the typhoon belt with occasionally severe damageTerrain:islands vary geologically from high mountainous islands to low, coral atolls; volcanic outcroppings on Pohnpei, Kosrae, and ChuukElevation extremes:lowest point: Pacific Ocean 0 mhighest point: Dolohmwar (Totolom) 791 m Natural resources:timber, marine products, deep-seabed minerals, phosphateLand use:arable land: 2.86% permanent crops: 24.29% other: 72.86% (2011) Irrigated land:NANatural hazards:typhoons (June to December)Environment - current issues:overfishing, climate change, pollutionEnvironment - international agreements:party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Ozone Layer Protection signed, but not ratified: none of the selected agreementsGeography - note:four major island groups totaling 607 islandsPeople and Society :: Micronesia, Federated States ofNationality:noun: Micronesian(s)adjective: Micronesian; Chuukese, Kosraen(s), Pohnpeian(s), Y apese Ethnic groups:Chuukese 48.8%, Pohnpeian 24.2%, Kosraean 6.2%, Yapese 5.2%, Yap outer islands 4.5%, Asian 1.8%, Polynesian 1.5%, other 6.4%, unknown 1.4% (2000 census)Languages:English (official and common language), Chuukese, Kosrean, Pohnpeian, Yapese, Ulithian, Woleaian, Nukuoro, KapingamarangiReligions:￼Roman Catholic 54.7%, Protestant 41.1% (includes Congregational 38.5%, Baptist 1.1%, Seventh Day Adventist 0.8%, Assembly of God .7%), Mormon 1.5%, other 1.9%, none 0.7%, unspecified 0.1% (2010 est.)Population:105,681 (July 2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 193Age structure:0-14 years: 31.9% (male 17,120/female 16,561)15-24 years: 20.2% (male 10,755/female 10,609)25-54 years: 38% (male 19,483/female 20,686)55-64 years: 3.4% (male 3,440/female 3,477)65 years and over: 3.2% (male 1,576/female 1,974) (2014 est.)

The islands have few known mineral deposits worth commercial exploration. The potential for tourism is also limited by isolation, lack of adequate facilities, and limited air and water connections hinder development. Under the terms of the original Compact, the US provided $1.3 billion in grants and aid in 1986-2001. The US and the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) negotiated a second (amended) Compact agreement in 2002-2003 that took effect in 2004. The amended Compact runs for a 20-year period to 2024; during which the US will provide roughly $2.1 billion to the FSM. The amended Compact also includes a Trust Fund for the people of the FSM which is to provide an income stream beyond 2024 when Compact grants are to end. The country's medium-term economic outlook appears fragile because of reduced US assistance and lackluster performance of its small and stagnant private sector.GDP (purchasing power parity):$754 million (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 210 $749.1 million (2012 est.)$746.8 million (2011 est.)note: GDP supplemented by grant aid, averaging perhaps $100 million annually GDP (official exchange rate):$339 million (2013 est.)GDP - real growth rate:0.6% (2013 est.)country comparison to0.4% (2012 est.) 2.1% (2011 est.)GDP - per capita (PPP):$7,300 (2013 est.)country comparison to$7,200 (2012 est.) $7,200 (2011 est.)the world: 181the world: 140GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 14%industry: 12%services: 74% (2011 est.)Agriculture - products:black pepper, tropical fruits and vegetables, coconuts, bananas, cassava (tapioca), sakau (kava), Kosraen citrus, betel nuts, sweet potatoes; pigs, chickens; fishIndustries:tourism, construction; fish processing, specialized aquaculture; craft items (from shell, wood, and pearls)Industrial production growth rate:NA%Labor force:15,920 (2011)country comparison to the world: 213Labor force - by occupation: agriculture: 0.9%industry: 20.6%services: 78.5%note: two-thirds of the labor force are government employees (2011 est.)
