￼The World FactbookCentral America and Caribbean :: Anguilla (overseas territory of the UK)Introduction :: AnguillaBackground:Colonized by English settlers from Saint Kitts in 1650, Anguilla was administered by Great Britain until the early 19th century, when the island - against the wishes of the inhabitants - was incorporated into a single British dependency along with Saint Kitts and Nevis. Several attempts at separation failed. In 1971, two years after a revolt, Anguilla was finally allowed to secede; this arrangement was formally recognized in 1980, with Anguilla becoming a separate British dependency.Geography :: AnguillaLocation:Caribbean, islands between the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, east of Puerto RicoGeographic coordinates:18 15 N, 63 10 WMap references:Central America and the CaribbeanArea:total: 91 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 227 land: 91 sq kmwater: 0 sq kmArea - comparative:about one-half the size of Washington, DCLand boundaries:0kmCoastline:61 kmMaritime claims:territorial sea: 3 n mexclusive fishing zone: 200 nm Climate:tropical; moderated by northeast trade windsTerrain:flat and low-lying island of coral and limestoneElevation extremes:lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m highest point: Crocus Hill 65 m Natural resources:salt, fish, lobsterLand use:arable land: 0%permanent crops: 0%other: 100% (mostly rock with sparse scrub oak, few trees, some commercial salt ponds) (2011) Irrigated land:NANatural hazards:frequent hurricanes and other tropical storms (July to October)Environment - current issues:supplies of potable water sometimes cannot meet increasing demand largely because of poor distribution systemGeography - note:the most northerly of the Leeward Islands in the Lesser AntillesPeople and Society :: AnguillaNationality:noun: Anguillan(s) adjective: Anguillan Ethnic groups:black (predominant) 90.1%, mixed, mulatto 4.6%, white 3.7%, other 1.5% (2001 census)Languages:￼English (official)Religions:Protestant 83.1% (Anglican 29%, Methodist 23.9%, other Protestant 30.2%), Roman Catholic 5.7%, other Christian 1.7%, other 5.2%, none or unspecified 4.3% (2001 census)Population:16,086 (July 2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 221 Age structure:0-14 years: 23.3% (male 1,918/female 1,826) 15-24 years: 14.1% (male 1,123/female 1,144) 25-54 years: 45% (male 3,269/female 3,965) 55-64 years: 8.3% (male 744/female 763)65 years and over: 8.1% (male 658/female 676) (2014 est.)

Increased activity in the tourism industry has spurred the growth of the construction sector contributing to economic growth. Anguillan officials have put substantial effort into developing the offshore financial sector, which is small but growing. In the medium term, prospects for the economy will depend largely on the tourism sector and, therefore, on revived income growth in the industrialized nations as well as on favorable weather conditions.GDP (purchasing power parity):$175.4 million (2009 est.)country comparison to the world: 221 $191.7 million (2008 est.)$108.9 million (2004 est.)GDP (official exchange rate):$175.4 million (2009 est.)GDP - real growth rate:-8.5% (2009 est.)country comparison to GDP - per capita (PPP):$12,200 (2008 est.)country comparison to GDP - composition, bythe world: 218the world: 104 end use:household consumption: 74.5% government consumption: 20.1% investment in fixed capital: 22.1% exports of goods and services: 43.7% imports of goods and services: -60.4%(2013 est.)GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 2.5%industry: 23.6%services: 73.8% (2013 est.)Agriculture - products:small quantities of tobacco, vegetables; cattle raisingIndustries:tourism, boat building, offshore financial servicesIndustrial production growth rate:2% (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 127 Labor force:6,049 (2001)country comparison to the world: 220 Labor force - by occupation:agriculture/fishing/forestry/mining: 4% manufacturing: 3%construction: 18%transportation and utilities: 10% commerce: 36%services: 29% (2000 est.)
