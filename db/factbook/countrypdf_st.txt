￼The World FactbookCentral America and Caribbean :: Saint Lucia Introduction :: Saint LuciaBackground:The island, with its fine natural harbor at Castries, was contested between England and France throughout the 17th and early 18th centuries (changing possession 14 times); it was finally ceded to the UK in 1814. Even after the abolition of slavery on its plantations in 1834, Saint Lucia remained an agricultural island, dedicated to producing tropical commodity crops. Self-government was granted in 1967 and independence in 1979.Geography :: Saint LuciaLocation:Caribbean, island between the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic Ocean, north of Trinidad and TobagoGeographic coordinates:13 53 N, 60 58 WMap references:Central America and the CaribbeanArea:total: 616 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 193 land: 606 sq kmwater: 10 sq kmArea - comparative:three and a half times the size of Washington, DCLand boundaries:0kmCoastline:158 kmMaritime claims:territorial sea: 1 2 n mcontiguous zone: 24 nmexclusive economic zone: 200 nmcontinental shelf: 200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin Climate:tropical, moderated by northeast trade winds; dry season January to April, rainy season May to AugustTerrain:volcanic and mountainous with some broad, fertile valleysElevation extremes:lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m highest point: Mount Gimie 950 m Natural resources:forests, sandy beaches, minerals (pumice), mineral springs, geothermal potentialLand use:arable land: 4.84% permanent crops: 11.29% other: 83.87% (2011) Irrigated land:30 sq km (2007)Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural): total: 0.02 cu km/yr (NA)per capita: 98.22 cu m/yr (2005)Natural hazards:hurricanes; volcanic activityEnvironment - current issues:deforestation; soil erosion, particularly in the northern regionEnvironment - international agreements:party to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Wetlands, Whalingsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreementsGeography - note:the twin Pitons (Gros Piton and Petit Piton), striking cone-shaped peaks south of Soufriere, are one of the scenic natural highlights of the Caribbean￼People and Society :: Saint LuciaNationality:noun: Saint Lucian(s) adjective: Saint Lucian Ethnic groups:black/African descent 85.3%, mixed 10.9%, East Indian 2.2%, other 1.6%, unspecified 0.1% (2010 est.)Languages:English (official), French patoisReligions:Roman Catholic 61.5%, Protestant 25.5% (includes Seventh Day Adventist 10.4%, Pentecostal 8.9%, Baptist 2.2%, Anglican 1.6%, Church of God 1.5%, other Protestant .9%), other Christian 3.4% (includes Evangelical 2.3% and Jehovah's Witness 1.1%), Rastafarian 1.9%, other 0.4%, none 5.9%, unspecified 1.4% (2010 est.)Population:163,362 (July 2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 187 Age structure:0-14 years: 21.2% (male 17,814/female 16,809)15-24 years: 16.6% (male 13,701/female 13,368)25-54 years: 42.9% (male 33,695/female 36,445)55-64 years: 10.5% (male 6,657/female 7,717)65 years and over: 10.2% (male 7,760/female 9,396) (2014 est.)

Tourism is Saint Lucia's main source of jobs and income - accounting for 65% of GDP - and the island's main source of foreign exchange earnings. The manufacturing sector is the most diverse in the Eastern Caribbean area. Crops such as bananas, mangos, and avocados continue to be grown for export, but St. Lucia's once solid banana industry has been devastated by strong competition. Saint Lucia is vulnerable to a variety of external shocks, including volatile tourism receipts, natural disasters, and dependence on foreign oil. Furthermore, high public debt - 77% of GDP in 2012 - and high debt servicing obligations constrain the ANTHONY administration's ability to respond to adverse external shocks. St. Lucia has experienced anemic growth since the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, largely because of a slowdown in tourism - airlines cut back on their routes to St. Lucia in 2012. Also, St. Lucia introduced a value added tax in 2012 of 15%, becoming the last country in the Eastern Caribbean to do so. In 2013, the government introduced a National Competitiveness and Productivity Council to address St. Lucia's high public wages and lack of productivity.GDP (purchasing power parity):$2.216 billion (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 191 $2.211 billion (2012 est.)$2.23 billion (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollars GDP (official exchange rate):$1.377 billion (2013 est.)GDP - real growth rate:0.2% (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 190 -0.9% (2012 est.)1.8% (2011 est.)GDP - per capita (PPP):$13,100 (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 100 $13,200 (2012 est.)$13,400 (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollars Gross national saving:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼17.4% of GDP (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 95 18.6% of GDP (2013 est.)15.3% of GDP (2013 est.)GDP - composition, by end use:household consumption: 60.6% government consumption: 19% investment in fixed capital: 31.5% investment in inventories: 0%exports of goods and services: 50.3% imports of goods and services: -61.3%(2013 est.)GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 3.1%industry: 17.4%services: 79.5% (2013 est.)Agriculture - products:bananas, coconuts, vegetables, citrus, root crops, cocoaIndustries:tourism; clothing, assembly of electronic components, beverages, corrugated cardboard boxes, lime processing, coconut processingIndustrial production growth rate:2.6%country comparison to the world: 114 Labor force:79,700 (2012)country comparison to the world: 184 Labor force - by occupation:agriculture: 21.7% industry: 24.7%services: 53.6% (2002 est.)
