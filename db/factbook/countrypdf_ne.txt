Government expenditures regularly exceed revenues, and the shortfall is made up by critically needed grants from New Zealand that are used to pay wages to public employees. Niue has cut government expenditures by reducing the public service by almost half. The agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of population because of emigration to New Zealand. Efforts to increase GDP include the promotion of tourism and financial services, although the International Banking Repeal Act of 2002 resulted in the termination of all offshore banking licenses. Economic aid from New Zealand in FY08/09 was US$5.7 million. While in the process of rebuilding, Niue has been dependent on foreign aid.GDP (purchasing power parity):$10.01 million (2003 est.)country comparison to the world: 228 GDP (official exchange rate):$10.01 million (2003)GDP - real growth rate:6.2% (2003 est.)country comparison to the world: 33GDP - per capita (PPP):$5,800 (2003 est.)country comparison to the world: 153GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 23.5%industry: 26.9%services: 49.5% (2003)Agriculture - products:coconuts, passion fruit, honey, limes, taro, yams, cassava (tapioca), sweet potatoes;
