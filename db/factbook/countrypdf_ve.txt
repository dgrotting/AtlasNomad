For most of the first half of the 20th century, Venezuela was ruled by generally benevolent military strongmen, who promoted the oil industry and allowed for some social reforms. Democratically elected governments have held sway since 1959. Hugo CHAVEZ, president from 1999 to 2013, sought to implement his "21st Century Socialism," which purported to alleviate social ills while at the same time attacking capitalist globalization and existing democratic institutions. His hand-picked successor, President Nicolas MADURO, is continuing CHAVEZ's socialist program. Current concerns include: a weakening of democratic institutions, political polarization, a politicized military, rampant violent crime, overdependence on the petroleum industry with its price fluctuations, and irresponsible mining operations that are endangering the rain forest and indigenous peoples.Geography :: VenezuelaLocation:Northern South America, bordering the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean, between Colombia and GuyanaGeographic coordinates:8 00 N, 66 00 WMap references:South AmericaArea:total: 912,050 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 33 land: 882,050 sq kmwater: 30,000 sq kmArea - comparative:almost six times the size of Georgia; slightly more than twice the size of CaliforniaLand boundaries:total: 4,993 kmborder countries: Brazil 2,200 km, Colombia 2,050 km, Guyana 743 kmCoastline:2,800 km￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Maritime claims:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼territorial sea: 1 2 n mcontiguous zone: 15 nmexclusive economic zone: 200 nmcontinental shelf: 200 m depth or to the depth of exploitationClimate:tropical; hot, humid; more moderate in highlandsTerrain:Andes Mountains and Maracaibo Lowlands in northwest; central plains (llanos); Guiana Highlands in southeastElevation extremes:lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m highest point: Pico Bolivar 5,007 mNatural resources:petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, gold, bauxite, other minerals, hydropower, diamondsLand use:arable land: 2.85% permanent crops: 0.71% other: 96.44% (2011)Irrigated land:10,550 sq km (2008)Total renewable water resources:1,233 cu km (2011)Freshwater withdrawal (domestic/industrial/agricultural): total: 9.06 cu km/yr (23%/4%/74%)per capita: 358.6 cu m/yr (2008)Natural hazards:subject to floods, rockslides, mudslides; periodic droughtsEnvironment - current issues:sewage pollution of Lago de Valencia; oil and urban pollution of Lago de Maracaibo; deforestation; soil degradation; urban and industrial pollution, especially along the Caribbean coast; threat to the rainforest ecosystem from irresponsible mining operationsEnvironment - international agreements:party to: Antarctic Treaty, Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol,Desertification, Endangered Species, Hazardous Wastes, Marine Life Conservation, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlandssigned but not ratified:: none of the selected agreementsGeography - note:on major sea and air routes linking North and South America; Angel Falls in the Guiana Highlands is the world's highest waterfallPeople and Society :: V enezuelaNationality:noun: Venezuelan(s) adjective: V enezuelanEthnic groups:Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Arab, German, African, indigenous peopleLanguages:Spanish (official), numerous indigenous dialectsReligions:nominally Roman Catholic 96%, Protestant 2%, other 2%￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Demographic profile:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Although poverty in Venezuela has declined during the CHAVEZ administration, dropping from nearly 50% in 1999 to about 27% in 2011, it remains high and some experts question how much of a role social expenditures have played in this poverty reduction. Progress in lowering poverty, income inequality, and unemployment may in fact be more closely linked to the rise and fall of prices for oil, Venezuela's dominant export. In the long-run, education and healthcare spending may increase economic growth and reduce income inequality, but rising costs and the staffing of new healthcare jobs with foreigners are slowing development. In the meantime, social investment has led to better living standards, including increased school enrollment, a substantial reduction in infant and child mortality, and greater access to potable water and sanitation.Since CHAVEZ came to power in 1999, more than a million predominantly middle- and upper-class Venezuelans are estimated to have emigrated. The brain drain is attributed to a repressive political system, lack of economic opportunities, steep inflation, a high crime rate, and corruption. Thousands of oil engineers emigrated to Canada, Colombia, and the United States following CHAVEZ's firing of over 20,000 employees of the state-owned petroleum company during a 2002-2003 oil strike. Additionally, thousands of Venezuelans of European descent have taken up residence in their ancestral homelands. Nevertheless, Venezuela continues to attract immigrants from South America and southern Europe because of its lenient migration policy and the availability of education and healthcare. Venezuela also has been a fairly accommodating host to more than 200,000 Colombian refugees.Population:28,868,486 (July 2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 46Age structure:0-14 years: 28.2% (male 4,143,840/female 3,985,489)15-24 years: 18.8% (male 2,723,856/female 2,697,672)25-54 years: 39.6% (male 5,614,922/female 5,818,903)55-64 years: 5.9% (male 1,030,898/female 1,137,894)65 years and over: 5.8% (male 755,183/female 959,829) (2014 est.)Dependency ratios:total dependency ratio: 53.2 % youth dependency ratio: 43.7 % elderly dependency ratio: 9.5 % potential support ratio: 10.6 (2013)Median age:total: 26.9 yearsmale: 26.1 yearsfemale: 27.6 years (2014 est.)Population growth rate:1.42% (2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 86Birth rate:19.42 births/1,000 population (2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 90Death rate:5.27 deaths/1,000 population (2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 182Net migration rate:0 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2014 est.)country comparison to the world: 83Urbanization:urban population: 93% of total population (2010)rate of urbanization: 1.7% annual rate of change (2010-15 est.)Major urban areas - population:CARACAS (capital) 3.051 million;

Fueled by high oil prices, record government spending helped to boost GDP growth in 2011, after a sharp drop in oil prices caused an economic contraction in 2009-10. Government spending, minimum wage hikes, and improved access to domestic credit created an increase in consumption which combined with supply problems to cause higher inflation - roughly 26% in 2011 and rising to more than 56% in 2013. Former President Hugo CHAVEZ's efforts to increase the government's control of the economy by nationalizing firms in the agribusiness, financial, construction, oil, and steel sectors hurt the private investment environment, reduced productive capacity, and slowednon-petroleum exports. In 2013, Venezuela continued to wrestle with a housing crisis, an electricity crisis, and rolling food and goods shortages - all of which were fallout from the government's unorthodox economic policies. The budget deficit for the entire government reached 17% of GDP in 2012. The deficit was trimmed to under 10% of GDP in 2013.GDP (purchasing power parity):$407.4 billion (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 34 $403.3 billion (2012 est.)$381.9 billion (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollarsGDP (official exchange rate):$367.5 billion (2013 est.)GDP -
