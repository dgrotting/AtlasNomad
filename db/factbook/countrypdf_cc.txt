Once the center of the Caribbean slave trade, Curacao was hard hit economically by the abolition of slavery in 1863. Its prosperity (and that of neighboring Aruba) was restored in the early 20th century with the construction of the Isla Refineria to service the newly discovered Venezuelan oil fields. In 1954, Curacao and several other Dutch Caribbean possessions were reorganized as the Netherlands Antilles, part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. In referenda in 2005 and 2009, the citizens of Curacao voted to become a self-governing country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands. The change in status became effective in October 2010 with the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles.Geography :: CuracaoLocation:Caribbean, an island in the Caribbean Sea - 55 km off the coast of VenezuelaGeographic coordinates:12 10 N, 69 00 WMap references:Central America and the CaribbeanArea:total: 444 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 200 land: 444 sq kmwater: 0 sq kmArea - comparative:more than twice the size of Washington, DCLand boundaries:0kmCoastline:364 kmMaritime claims:territorial sea: 1 2 n m exclusive fishing zone: 12 nmClimate:tropical marine climate, ameliorated by northeast trade winds, results in mild temperatures; semiarid with average rainfall of 600 mm/yearTerrain:generally low, hilly terrainElevation extremes:lowest point: Caribbean Sea 0 m highest point: Mt.

Although GDP grew slightly during the past decade, the island enjoys a high per capita income and a well-developed infrastructure compared with other countries in the region. Curacao has an excellent natural harbor that can accommodate large oil tankers. Venezuelan state oil company PdVSA, under a contract in effect until 2019, leases the single refineryon the island from the government, employing some 1,500 people; most of the oil for the refinery is imported from Venezuela; most of the refined products are exported to the US. Almost all consumer and capital goods are imported, with the US, Brazil, Italy, and Mexico being the major suppliers. The government is attempting to diversify its industry and trade and has signed an Association Agreement with the EU to expand business there. Most of Curacao’s GDP results from services. Curacao has limited natural resources, poor soils, and inadequate water supplies, and budgetary problems complicate reform of the health and education systems. In 2013 the government implemented changes to the sales tax and reformed the public pension and health care systems, including increasing the sales tax from 5% to as high as 9% on some products, raising the age for public pension withdrawals to 65, and requiring citizens to pay higher premiums.GDP (purchasing power parity):$2.838 billion (2008 est.)country comparison to the world: 184 $2.606 billion (2007 est.)$2.452 billion (2006 est.)note: data are in 2008 US dollarsGDP (official exchange rate):$5.08 billion (2008 est.)GDP - real growth rate:0% (2012 est.)country comparison to the world: 196 3.5% (2008)2.2% (2007)GDP - per capita (PPP):$15,000 (2004 est.)country comparison to the world: 91GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 0.7%industry: 15.5%services: 83.8% (2012 est.)Agriculture - products:aloe, sorghum, peanuts, vegetables, tropical fruitIndustries:tourism, petroleum refining, petroleum transshipment facilities, light manufacturingIndustrial production growth rate:NA%Labor force:62,040 (2011)country comparison to the world: 186Labor force - by occupation: agriculture: 1.2%industry: 16.9%services: 81.8% (2008 est.)Unemployment rate:9.8% (2011 est.)country comparison to the world: 105 10.3% (2008 est.)Taxes and other revenues:10.8% of GDP (2011 est.)country comparison to the world: 207Budget surplus (+) or deficit (-):-0.9% of GDP (2011 est.)country comparison to the world: 61Inflation rate (consumer prices):2.3% (2011 est.)country comparison to the world: 84 1.3% (2010 est.)Exports:$1.5 billion (2011 est.)country comparison to the world: 148 $1.4 billion (2010 est.)￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Exports - commodities:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼petroleum products￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Imports:$2.5 billion (2011 est.)country comparison to the world: 155 $2.648 billion (2009 est.)Imports - commodities:crude petroleum, food, manufacturesExchange rates:Netherlands Antillean guilders (ANG) per US dollar - 1.79 (2011)1.79 (2011 est.)1.79 (2010 est.)1.79 (2009) 1.79 (2008)note: the Netherland Antillean guilder was replaced by the newly created Caribbean guilder in 2013 Energy:: CuracaoElectricity - production:1.167 billion kWh (2008 est.)country comparison to the world: 143Electricity - consumption:968 million kWh (2008 est.)country comparison to the world: 151Electricity - exports:0 kWh (2009 est.)country comparison to the world: 114Electricity - imports:0 kWh (2009 est.)country comparison to the world: 123Crude oil - proved reserves:0 bbl (1 January 2011 es)country comparison to the world: 114 Refined petroleum products -production:531.1 bbl/day (2010 est.)country comparison to the world: 112 Refined petroleum products -consumption:72,000 bbl/day (2010 est.)country comparison to the world: 90Refined petroleum products - exports:211,100 bbl/day (2009 est.)country comparison to the world: 30 Refined petroleum products -imports:291,700 bbl/day (2009 est.)country comparison to the world: 23Natural gas - production:0 cu m (2009 est.)country comparison to the world: 111Natural gas - consumption:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼0 cu m (2009 est.)country comparison toNatural gas - exports:0 cu m (2009 est.)country comparison toNatural gas - imports:0 cu m (2009 est.)country comparison tothe world: 127the world: 75the world: 170￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Natural gas - proved reserves:0 cu m (1 January 2011 es)country comparison to the world: 121 Communications :: CuracaoTelephone system: international: country code - 599￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼Broadcast media:￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼government-run Telecuracao operates a TV station and a radio station;
