The French assumed control in 1715, developing the island into an important naval base overseeing Indian Ocean trade, and establishing a plantation economy of sugar cane. The British captured the island in 1810, during the Napoleonic Wars. Mauritius remained a strategically important British naval base, and later an air station, playing an important role during World War II for anti-submarine and convoy operations, as well as the collection of signals intelligence. Independence from the UK was attained in 1968. A stable democracy with regular free elections and a positive human rights record, the country has attracted considerable foreign investment and has earned one of Africa's highest per capita incomes.Geography :: MauritiusLocation:Southern Africa, island in the Indian Ocean, east of MadagascarGeographic coordinates:20 17 S, 57 33 EMap references:AfricaArea:total: 2,040 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 181land: 2,030 sq kmwater: 10 sq kmnote: includes Agalega Islands, Cargados Carajos Shoals (Saint Brandon), and RodriguesArea -

Mauritius has achieved steady and strong growth over the last several decades, resulting in more equitable income distribution, increased life expectancy, lowered infant mortality, and a much-improved infrastructure. The economy rests on sugar, tourism, textiles and apparel, and financial services, and is expanding into fish processing, information and communications technology, and hospitality and property development. Sugarcane is grown on about 90% of the cultivated land area and accounts for 15% of export earnings. The government's development strategy centers on creating vertical and horizontal clusters of development in these sectors. Mauritius has attracted more than 32,000 offshore entities, many aimed at commerce in India, South Africa, and China. Investment in the banking sector alone has reached over $1 billion. Mauritius, with its strong textile sector, has been well poised to take advantage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Mauritius' sound economic policies and prudent banking practices helped to mitigate negative effects of the global financial crisis in 2008-09. GDP grew in the 3-4% per year range in 2010-13, and the country continues to expand its trade and investment outreach around the globe.GDP (purchasing power parity):$20.95 billion (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 131 $20.26 billion (2012 est.)$19.61 billion (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollarsGDP (official exchange rate):$11.9 billion (2013 est.)GDP -
