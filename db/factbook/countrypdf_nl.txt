After a 20-year French occupation, a Kingdom of the Netherlands was formed in 1815. In 1830 Belgium seceded and formed a separate kingdom. The Netherlands remained neutral in World War I, but suffered invasion and occupation by Germany in World War II. A modern, industrialized nation, the Netherlands is also a large exporter of agricultural products. The country was a founding member of NATO and the EEC (now the EU) and participated in the introduction of the euro in 1999. In October 2010, the former Netherlands Antilles was dissolved and the three smallest islands - Bonaire, Sint Eustatius, and Saba - became special municipalities in the Netherlands administrative structure. The larger islands of Sint Maarten and Curacao joined the Netherlands and Aruba as constituent countries forming the Kingdom of the Netherlands.Geography :: NetherlandsLocation:Western Europe, bordering the North Sea, between Belgium and GermanyGeographic coordinates:52 30 N, 5 45 EMap references:EuropeArea:total: 41,543 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 135 land: 33,893 sq kmwater: 7,650 sq kmArea - comparative:slightly less than twice the size of New JerseyLand boundaries:total: 1,027 kmborder countries: Belgium 450 km, Germany 577 kmCoastline:451 kmMaritime claims:territorial sea: 1 2 n m contiguous zone: 24 nm exclusive fishing zone: 200 nmClimate:temperate;

Industrial activity is predominantly in food processing, chemicals, petroleum refining, and electrical machinery. A highly mechanized agricultural sector employs only 2% of the labor force but provides large surpluses for the food-processing industry and for exports. The Netherlands, along with 11 of its EU partners, began circulating the euro currency on 1 January 2002. After 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth, the Dutch economy - highly dependent on an international financial sector and international trade - contracted by 3.5% in 2009 as a result of the global financial crisis. The Dutch financial sector suffered, due in part to the high exposure of some Dutch banks to U.S. mortgage-backed securities. In 2008, the government nationalized two banks and injected billions of dollars of capital into other financial institutions, to prevent further deterioration of a crucial sector. The government also sought to boost the domestic economy by accelerating infrastructure programs, offering corporate tax breaks for employers to retain workers, and expanding export credit facilities. The stimulus programs and bank bailouts, however, resulted in a government budget deficit of 5.3% of GDP in 2010 that contrasted sharply with a surplus of 0.7% in 2008. The government of Prime Minister Mark RUTTE began implementing fiscal consolidation measures in early 2011, mainly reductions in expenditures, which resulted in an improved budget deficit in 2011. In 2012-13 tax revenues dropped, GDP contracted, and the budget deficit deteriorated. Although jobless claims continued to grow, the unemployment rate remained relatively low at 6.8 percent.GDP (purchasing power parity):$696.3 billion (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 24 $705.3 billion (2012 est.)$714.2 billion (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollarsGDP (official exchange rate):$800.5 billion (2013 est.)GDP - real growth rate:-1.3% (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 205 -1.2% (2012 est.)0.9% (2011 est.)GDP - per capita (PPP):$41,400 (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 24 $42,100 (2012 est.)$42,800 (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollarsGross national saving:26.2% of GDP (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 42 27.5% of GDP (2012 est.)28.3% of GDP (2011 est.)GDP - composition, by end use: household consumption: 45.3% government consumption: 27.7% investment in fixed capital: 15.7% investment in inventories: 0.4% exports of goods and services: 86% imports of goods and services: -75.2%(2013 est.)GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 2.6%industry: 25.4%services: 72.1% (2013 est.)Agriculture - products:grains, potatoes, sugar beets, fruits, vegetables;
