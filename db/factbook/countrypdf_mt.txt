The island staunchly supported the UK through both world wars and remained in the Commonwealth when it became independent in 1964. A decade later Malta became a republic. Since about the mid-1980s, the island has transformed itself into a freight transshipment point, a financial center, and a tourist destination. Malta became an EU member in May 2004 and began using the euro as currency in 2008.Geography :: MaltaLocation:Southern Europe, islands in the Mediterranean Sea, south of Sicily (Italy)Geographic coordinates:35 50 N, 14 35 EMap references:EuropeArea:total: 316 sq kmcountry comparison to the world: 208 land: 316 sq kmwater: 0 sq kmArea -

the smallest economy in the euro zone - produces only about 20% of its food needs, has limited fresh water supplies, and has few domestic energy sources. Malta's geographic position between Europe and North Africa makes it a target for irregular migration, which has strained Malta's political and economic resources. Malta's fertility rate is below the EU average, and population growth in recent years has largely been from immigration, putting increasing pressure on the pension system. Malta adopted the euro on 1 January 2008. Malta's economy is dependent on foreign trade, manufacturing, and tourism, and was hurt by the global economic downturn, but fared better than most other EU member states. Malta has low unemployment relative to other European countries, and growth has recovered since the 2009 recession. Malta's financial services industry has grown in recent years and it has avoided contagion from the European financial crisis, largely because its debt is mostly held domestically and its banks have low exposure to the sovereign debt of peripheral European countries. The EU reopened an excessive deficit procedure against Malta in June 2013, having found that its forecasted deficit for the year was likely to exceed 3% of GDP.GDP (purchasing power parity):$11.46 billion (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 152 $11.19 billion (2012 est.)$10.89 billion (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollarsGDP (official exchange rate):$9.315 billion (2013 est.)GDP - real growth rate:1.1% (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 170 1% (2012 est.)1.8% (2011 est.)GDP - per capita (PPP):$27,500 (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 54 $26,900 (2012 est.)$26,200 (2011 est.)note: data are in 2013 US dollarsGross national saving:13.7% of GDP (2013 est.)country comparison to the world: 116 13.5% of GDP (2012 est.)12.8% of GDP (2011 est.)GDP - composition, by end use: household consumption: 58% government consumption: 21.6% investment in fixed capital: 13.2% investment in inventories: -0.1% exports of goods and services: 94.2% imports of goods and services: -86.9%(2013 est.)GDP - composition, by sector of origin: agriculture: 1.5%industry: 13.4%services: 85.1% (2012 est.)Agriculture - products:potatoes, cauliflower, grapes, wheat, barley, tomatoes, citrus, cut flowers, green peppers;
